    <p>Classes I took in order of enjoyment (not including electives)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Systems Programming</li>
      <li>Intro to Digital Logic</li>
      <li>Discrete Math</li>
      <li>Data Structures & Algorithms</li>
      <li>Calc 3</li>
      <li>Calc 2</li>
      <li>SWE Principles</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Systems Programming</b> was by far my favorite class. We spent a lot of time learning about C and ASM which I really enjoyed. I was introduced to a ton of fundamental ideas in computer science that has completely changed how I write code. Projects were so hard. Much growth occured here.</p>
    <p><b>Digital Logic</b> was especially awesome because my prof was also a climber. Super intereseting content, specifically boolean logic that has been very useful in future classes.</p>
    <p><b>Discrete Math</b> mainly helped me improve my algebra and problem solving skills. Graphs and recursion content was interesting and useful.</p>
    <p><b>DSA</b> was cool but honestly just boring for me. Not a bad class, I just haven't found the content engaging since most of it I can easily find online. Understanding Big O has been useful when leetcoding though. I feel that as I progress through my CS and programming journey I will gain a deeper appreciation for this course.</p>
    <p><b>Calc</b> was simple and not too hard. Helped me get better at algebra and solving problems.</p>
    <p><b>SWE Principles</b> was not very helpful. Kinda useful as an intro to C++ but so far that is all I benefited from.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>During this year I grew more than ever. This is the hardest I have ever been academically challenged and I am incredibly thankful for this experience. I have such an immensely daunting journey ahead but nonetheless I am super excited for what is to come. Much growth to come. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this goofy post (this will likely just be something for me to reflect back on)!</p>
