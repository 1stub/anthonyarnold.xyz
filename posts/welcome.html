        <p>I feel like I should mention this before anyone really reads this blog (if you do happen to stumble upon this page, I love you), I am not a web developer. Or at least not right now.
            I spend most of my time working in C or C++, and I have been working on deepening my understanding of fundamental programming/computing abstractions (the answer to any question is abstraction :) ). 
            However, this site serves as a place for me to speak freely on whatever. I have no intention for what I will write about here or how frequently.</p>
        <p>I should also mention I did not create this from scratch. I took inspiration from <a href="https://tokisuno.rocks/">tokisuno</a>. His posts are going to be more interesting than mine,
            but nice site format.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, I feel that this site will be a nice place for me to speak my mind, and I do not intend to stop posting here. I'm sure breaks will be taken, but I hope for some sense
            of consistency.</p>
