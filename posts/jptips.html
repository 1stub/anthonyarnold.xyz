        Now that I am closing in on two years since I started learning Japanese I can fairly say I've experimented with just about every 
        tool out there and figured it would be nice to consolidate everything into one place. I'm by no means fluent, but I am able to
        read just about anything I encounter (with some dictionary lookups) without thinking much of grammar or sentence structure. Things
        just make sense, similar to how English feels when reading. There is no intentonal translation, the Japanese text simply enters my brain, 
        is processed, and meaning is extracted. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        Before I get into the tools that helped me find success, I should mention my focus was on <i>immersion</i>, not using text books. This means
        a typical "study" session just consists of reading books, Wikipedia articles, blog posts, or enjoying a good show. I use a spaced repition flashcard program 
        called <a href = "https://apps.ankiweb.net/" >Anki</a>, but never has it been my only resource. Flash cards and proper studying (e.g. memorizing grammar & vocab)
        are meerly <i>supplements</i> to speed things up, but not by any means necessary.
    </p>
    <p>   
        Now that thats out of the way, what tools would I say were critical to my success and not exactly common knowledge?

    <h2>Android Ereader</h2>
    <p>
        My largest gains have come from getting myself an android ereader. You can find some models for around $250 USD. I personally use 
        the <a href = "https://shop.boox.com/collections/goseries"> Boox Go 7 BW</a>
        and really enjoy it.
        Why not just get a kindle? Well, if you value actually <a href = "https://voxday.net/2025/02/18/you-dont-own-your-ebooks/">owning your books</a>, 
        avoiding propritery software, and not having your faced shoved with ads (all of which a sad reality as we move towards a late-stage capitalist society), perhaps
        it's time to take a step back. Now, I will not say Boox is perfect. It is far from. They have a reputation for 
        <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox/comments/19czc16/a_general_warning_about_boox_boox_tablets_boox/">bad customer service</a>, buggy screens,
        and broken firmware updates (as a screen bug I was having only occured on a more recent firmware version). If you can tolerate the rough edges, the screen
        is very responsive and crisp, devices are nice and light, excellent battery life, you get access to the andrioid app store, and (at least the model I mentioned 
        previously) won't break the bank. But, at the end of the day, I am just a dude on the web, so please don't listen to be blindly --- do your own research first!
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, why have I found an ereader to be so ground breaking? Well, besides the fact my eyes no longer feel they are falling out of my face after a long 
        reading session, I have been able to get Anki and <a href = "https://github.com/KamWithK/AnkiconnectAndroid">AnkiConnect Android</a> setup, 
        allowing me to <a href = "https://animecards.site/ankicards/">mine vocabulary</a> fully from a tablet without any 
        internet connection. The screen is fast enough to where mining new words is very fast and painless and getting <a href = "https://learnjapanese.moe/yomichan/">yomitan</a> setup 
        (a popup dictionary browser extension) was pretty straight forward. I now have a device I can take anywhere, mine new words, and lookup unknown ones 
        with ease! It really is quite effective at <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/productivity-tips-hints-hacks-tricks-for-grad-students-academics/#dead">salveging dead time</a> 
        through my day with banging out a few pages or reading an interesting blog.
